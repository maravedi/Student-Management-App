Student-Management-App
======================

This is a PHP program (with MySQL) designed primarily at helping teachers learn their students' names.

The final design is meant to include an admin interface for teachers to input their schools, classes and students.  Also, there will be a game interface for teachers to play a game that will quiz them on the names of their students, using the students' pictures.

I have the intention of creating a more complex game system that allows the teacher to increase the difficulty of the game.  Also, I plan to create the ability for the teacher to choose which classes to include in the game, so that they can have a pool of more than one class on which they are being tested during a given game.
